My name is Richard. I dabble in technology, music, writing, and play games whenever I'm able. Proud member of the Oregon Trail Generation.

Currently Director of Technology for Tulsa Remote. Trying to learn and apply Python 🐍. Would love to be involved with the development and release of a video game someday.
